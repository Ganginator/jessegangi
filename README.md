NOTES:


The old repository became corrupted on 6/18/13.
I cloned this from the master branch.
I marked other repository as 'CORRUPTED', and saved it for the history.

This is an mix of:
HTML5 Boilerplate: //html5boilerplate.com/,
Bootstrap: //getbootstrap.com/,
Font Awesome: //fontawesome.io/,
TimelineJS: //timeline.knightlab.com/,
Bootstrapx Clickover: https://github.com/lecar-red/bootstrapx-clickover,
and my own code, including many references.

I'm using it for my Online Resume, my business Aerial Applications, Templating, and Examples.

I'm still modifying for personal use, and will remove unnecessary stuff as I go.

I'm still considering minifying everything when finished.
However, I am having issues with getting Grunt to work on my server.

Contact me if you are interested in hiring me, with any errors, suggestions, or help.


SPEC SPECIFIC NOTES:


HTML5 does not require you to wrap your attributes in quotes, and you do not have to close your elements. However, I prefer the XHTML structured semantic approach, even though it can seem redundant.

DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE the lang attribute in '&lt;html class="no-js" lang="en"&gt;' IF YOUR LANGUAGE IS NOT English!

VERIFY profile: '&lt;head profile="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/profile"&gt'

I do not indent the body, use it as a wrapper, or indent any wrappers.

It is no longer necessary to use the type attribute in stylesheets, it is implied in HTML5!

AS ALWAYS, THE ORDER OF THE STACK IS IMPORTANT!!!

EMPTY fields are for referencing what elements the code contains, whether or not I am applying a style.

I also add some unnecessary DIVs, ID's, and Styles for referencing.

So don't be too surprised. ;)

IN DATABASE SITES, THE #page CONTENT AREA'S width, THE #page GLOBALS, AND THE content ARE DESIGNATED BY A DYNAMIC ?page=/?pagename= QUERY REFERENCING style, layout, AND content TABLES.

IN DATABASELESS SITES, THE #page CONTENT IS FETCHED WITH $_GET BASED ON ?page=, AND THE RESPECTIVE FILES ARE LOCATED IN ~includes/content; WHILE THE LAYOUT IS DETERMINED BY THE RESPECTIVE FILES LOCATED IN ~includes.

CONSIDER CHANGING TO em's OR rem's
http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw
100% = 1 em ~= 16px ~= 14pt

css.php contains all CSS links for reference.

All JavaScript is inserted at the bottom, in #feet, so the pages load faster, except Modernizr for HTML5/CSS3 feature detection, and HTML5 Shiv for enabling HTML5 in IE. Technically Modernizer 1.5+ includes HTML5 Shiv.
Modernizr 2 (re)introduced modular builds. After testing create a customized build (using only the tests you need) for a production-ready, minified, and compressed version.

HTML5 Shiv, and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements, and media queries.
WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file://

VERIFY NECESSITY OF ALL SHIMS!

Apple Touch Icons have relative support for Android.
Precomposed = No Gloss

DO I HAVE TO Place Apple Touch Icons in the ROOT directory?
DO I HAVE TO Place Favicons in the ROOT directory?
SHOULD I have one favicon.ico in the ROOT directory?

It is no longer necessary to use the type attribute in scripts, it is implied in HTML5!

js.php contains all JavaScript links for reference.

Also, I added an image preloader.

* INFORMATION *


CSS Definitions:


ID = Singular.
e.g. A person's Identification (ID) is unique to one person.

Class = Multiple.
e.g. There are many people in a class.

Padding = Inside.
Defines the space inside the element between the content, and the element's border.

Margin = Outside.
Defines the space outside the element between the element's border, and other elements.


Quick CSS px to em Conversions:


40px / 16 = 2.5em
16 * 0.0625em = 1px
22px = 16 * em
22px / 16 = em
px / 16 = em
em = px / 16


Word Equations:

[ ( NEW - OLD ) / OLD ] * 100 = DIFFERENCE%

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but here's my number, so call me, maybe?
