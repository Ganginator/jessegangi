<h4>Ganginator's Notes:</h4>

<h5>The old repository became corrupted on 6/18/13.<br />
Cloned this from master.<br />
Marked other repository as "CORRUPTED" and saved it for the history.</h5>

<p><strong>Check back easily by bookmarking this in your favorite browser!</strong></p>

<h5>Use a shortcut: Ctrl+D, Cmd+D</h5>

<p>This is an mix of HTML5 Boilerplate http://html5boilerplate.com/, Bootstrap  http://getbootstrap.com/, and Font Awesome http://fontawesome.io/, and my own code, including many references.<br />
<br />
I'm using it for my Online Resume, my business Aerial Applications, Templating, and Examples.<br />
<br />
I'm Still Modifying for personal use, and will remove unnecessary stuff as I go.<br />
<br />
I'm Still considering minifying everything when finished.<br />
<br />
Contact me if you are interested in hiring me, or with any errors, suggestions, or help.<br />
<br />
I also add some unnecessary DIVs, ID's, and Styles for referencing.<br />
<br />
So don't be too surprised. ;-)</p>


NOTES:

EMPTY fields are for referencing what elements the code contains, whether or not I am applying a style.

IN DATABASE SITES, THE #page CONTENT AREA'S width, THE #page GLOBALS, AND THE content ARE DESIGNATED BY A DYNAMIC ?page=/?pagename= QUERY REFERENCING style, layout, AND content TABLES.

IN TEMPLATE SITES, WITHOUT A DATABASE, THE #page CONTENT IS FETCHED WITH $_GET BASED ON ?page=, AND THE RESPECTIVE FILES ARE LOCATED IN ~includes/content; WHILE THE LAYOUT IS DETERMINED BY THE RESPECTIVE FILES LOCATED IN ~includes.

CONSIDER CHANGING TO em's OR rem's

<h4>Information:</h4>


<h5>HTML5 does not require you to wrap your attributes in quotes, and you do not have to close your elements. I, however, prefer the XHTML Structured Semantic approach even though it can seem redundant.</h5>


CONFIGURATION:

TIE FIGHTER - Custom DOG PHP Templates

I do not indent the body, use it as a wrapper, or indent any wrappers.</h5>


<p><strong>LEFTOVERS WILL BE REMOVED!</strong></p>
