## NOTES:

I'm using it for my Online Resume, Templating, and Examples.

I'm still modifying for personal use, and will remove unnecessary stuff as I go.

I'm still considering minifying everything when finished. 

Contact me if you are interested in hiring me, with any errors, suggestions, or help.


## SPEC SPECIFIC NOTES:

I do not indent the body, use it as a wrapper, or indent any wrappers.

EMPTY fields are for referencing what elements the code contains, whether or not I am applying a style.

IN DATABASE SITES, THE #page CONTENT AREA'S width, THE #page GLOBALS, AND THE content ARE DESIGNATED BY A DYNAMIC ?page=/?pagename= QUERY REFERENCING style, layout, AND content TABLES.

IN DATABASELESS SITES, THE #page CONTENT IS FETCHED WITH $_GET BASED ON ?page=, AND THE RESPECTIVE FILES ARE LOCATED IN ~includes/content; WHILE THE LAYOUT IS DETERMINED BY THE RESPECTIVE FILES LOCATED IN ~includes.

40px / 16 = 2.5em  
16 * 0.0625em = 1px  
22px = 16 * em  
22px / 16 = em  
px / 16 = em  
em = px / 16
